# Zzzzznake

A twisted version of the classic Snake game
---

## Description

Zzzzznake is a game where the player maneuvers a snake which grows and speeds up throughout the game.

The player must keep the snake from colliding with the boardgame walls and tree obstacles. As the snake grows and speeds up, it gets more and more difficult to avoid trees and stay on the board. Additionally you have the opportunity to collect points and try beating your own highscore.

The original snake game is from a 1976 two-player arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to survive longer than the other player. The concept evolved into a single-player variant where a snake gets longer with each piece of food eatenâ€”often apples or eggs. 


## Instructions for play

Use the arrow keys to move the player within the board.
Collect food (red squares) to speed up the snake, grow & earn 3 points. 
Collect coins (gold sqaures) to earn 5 points.
Avoid trees (green squares) - if you hit one, you will lose a life.
Make sure you stay within the game board! If you hit the walls of the game board you will immediately end the game and lose all of your hard earned points!

Enjoy!
